# Four PhD positions on the attribution of extreme climate events (posted 23 April 2024)
## General overview

Europe and other mid- and high-latitude regions in the world have experienced a number of unprecedented
extreme climatic events in the past years, in particular heatwaves and droughts, as well as
catastrophic floods like those that occurred in Belgium in the summer of 2021. Attribution is the research
area at the crossover of climate science and statistics that aims at evaluating the relative contributions
of different causal factors to the occurrence of extreme events. It serves in particular to pinpoint the
possible role of anthropogenic climate change in these extremes.

We are seeking **four talented PhD candidates to join us in the effort to better constrain the
probabilities of occurrence of past and future extreme events and to arrive at robust attribution
statements that do not understate nor overstate the future risks society will face**. The different
positions, described in further detail below, are centered around different types of climate events (*floods*
over Europe, *heatwaves* and compound *drought-heat* events over Europe, and *sea ice extent reduction* in
the Antarctic), each leading to distinct methodological challenges.

This interdisciplinary project involves multiple research institutes: the Namur Institute for Complex
Systems [naXys](https://www.naxys.be/) at UNamur, the Earth and Climate Center (part of [ELI](https://www.uclouvain.be/eli), the Earth and Life Institute)
at UCLouvain, and the institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (part of [LIDAM](https://www.uclouvain.be/lidam), the
Louvain Institute of Data Analysis and Modeling in economics and statistics) at UCLouvain.

The PhD grants are financed through the *Action de Recherche Concertée (ARC)* called EXALT - EXtreme
weather Attribution at mid- and high-Latitudes using advanced statistical Techniques, under the
supervision of profs. Francesco Ragone, Franc¸ois Massonnet and Johan Segers from UCLouvain and
Anna Kiriliouk from UNamur. 

## Position 1: attribution of European floods

Main affiliation: UNamur
Secondary affiliation: UCLouvain
Keywords: Attribution, Extreme-value theory, Floods, Non-stationarity

*Description of work*:

The PhD candidate will investigate flexible and physically realistic non-stationary extreme-value models
for attribution of heavy precipitation and floods over different regions of Europe. In particular, the
candidate will identify physical covariates that take into account the regional response to climate change
in both thermodynamical and dynamical properties.

Different models with different covariates are expected to be selected for different regions of Europe.
A first broad-scale differentiation will be made in terms of Central-Northern Europe versus Southern
Europe and the Mediterranean area, justified by the expected response of the atmospheric circulation to
climate change. After a general analysis, the candidate will zoom in on regions that recently experienced
unprecedented floods (Belgium, Northern Italy and Southern France), and use the developed models to
arrive at an attribution statement.

## Position 2: attribution of European heatwaves

Main affiliation: UCLouvain
Keywords: Attribution, Clustering, Extreme-value theory, Heatwaves, Tail dependence

*Description of work*:

The PhD candidate will focus on the attribution of European heatwaves using multivariate techniques
that take into account spatio-temporal dependence and compounding mechanisms between high
temperature and soil dryness.

In particular, the candidate will develop (bivariate) spatial extreme-value models for different classes
of heatwave events in Europe, with the aim of better identifying typical regional heatwave patterns
within Europe and analysing concurrent drought-heat events. Finally, the candidate will detect and
attribute changes in the properties of heatwaves in response to increased CO2 emissions, provide robust
estimates of return periods for recently observed events (such as the 2023 Cerberus heatwave), and
quantify the increase of the risk of heatwave events in future scenarios.

## Position 3: attribution of European droughts

Main affiliation: UCLouvain
Keywords: Attribution, Droughts, Extreme-value theory, Non-stationarity, Rare event algorithm

*Description of work*:

The PhD candidate will focus on the attribution of European droughts using multivariate techniques
that take into account spatio-temporal dependence and compounding mechanisms between high
temperature and soil dryness.

In particular, the candidate will analyse the multi-year temporal compounding aspect, the relation
with surface temperature anomalies at seasonal and inter-annual scales, and the relation to the low
frequency variability of the atmosphere. In addition, large datasets of extreme multi-year droughts will
be generated with rare event algorithms applied to numerical climate models of different complexity.
Finally, non-stationary extreme value models will be developed to quantify future changes in the
probability of occurrence of prolonged extreme droughts and to arrive at solid attribution statements
for recent events.


## Position 4: attribution of low Antarctic sea ice

Main affiliation: UCLouvain
Secondary affiliation: UNamur
Keywords: Attribution, Extreme-value theory, Non-stationariy, Sea ice extent, Tail dependence

*Description of work*:

The PhD candidate will use multivariate techniques to obtain better insight in the nature of Antarctic
extreme sea ice states and to arrive at a robust and precise attribution statement of recent record lows.

Regional aspects are key to understand Antarctic sea ice dynamics. The Southern Ocean is comprised
of several sub-basins. The seasonal development of sea ice, as well as its inter-annual variability, are
dictated by processes that are basin-specific. The PhD candidate will characterise the tail dependence
between the sea ice extent in these five sub-basins and select appropriate multivariate extreme-value
models. Next, he/she will make an observation-based attribution statement, which will be complemented
by a storyline approach based on the use of a climate model.
