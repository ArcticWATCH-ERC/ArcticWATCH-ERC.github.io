[**Patricia DeRepentigny**](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/patricia.derepentigny) is a postdoctoral researcher at the *Earth and Climate Centre* of the Earth & Life Institute at UCLouvain. Her research focuses on future projections of Arctic sea ice and the multiple drivers of sea ice retreat on seasonal to century time scales in the context of forcing uncertainty and internal variability of the climate system.
