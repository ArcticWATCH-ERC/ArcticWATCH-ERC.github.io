The Arctic is currently transitioning toward a new climatic state that will be characterized by seasonally sea ice-
free conditions almost every year from the 2050s [1,2,3], with widespread ecological, climatic, and societal
consequences [4].

*Arctic sea ice historical records and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) projections* (fig. 9.13. of the IPCC 6th Assessment Report (10.1017/9781009157896.011)[https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/figures/chapter-9/figure-9-13]*


There is growing evidence that the future summer sea ice retreat will not occur at a constant
rate. Indeed, climate model simulations are suggestive of pronounced sub-decadal fluctuations on top of the
long-term trend, leading to periods of relative stability followed by abrupt sea ice decline in hardly 3-5 years.
A lot remains to be understood regarding the precursors, mechanisms, predictability, and impacts of these rapid
events. In particular, it is unclear how close we might be to the next one.
The overall objective of this project, ArcticWATCH, is to build an integrated early warning system that alerts
on the possibility of rapid Arctic sea ice loss for the following summer up to five years. This system will
provide annually updated assessments and will synthesize multiple lines of evidence harvested from various
data sources (pre-existing and generated during the project), including climate model projections, initialized
climate model and machine-learning-based predictions, satellite observations, and climate reconstructions.
By introducing innovative targeted numerical experiments, ArcticWATCH will also identify the new pathways
of sea ice predictability in a warmer world and will thereby provide evidence-based guidance regarding the
design of the Arctic observing system for the next 30 years. Finally, ArcticWATCH will make a leap forward
in depicting environmental impacts during and after rapid sea ice loss events, from short (Arctic heatwaves
and precipitation extremes) to long (interactions with the Arctic and North Atlantic oceanic circulation)
timescales.
The hypothesis that, after a decade of relatively stable conditions, Arctic sea ice is poised to an abrupt decline
before 2030, will be paid utmost attention.
