# Research program

## WP1: Attribution of European floods
The aim of WP1 is to propose **flexible and physically realistic non-stationary extreme-value models
for attribution of heavy precipitation and floods over different regions of Europe**

## WP2: Attribution of European heatwaves and droughts
WP2 focuses on the **attribution of European heatwaves and droughts using multivariate techniques
that take into account spatio-temporal dependence and compounding mechanisms between
high temperature and soil dryness.**

## WP3: Attribution of low Antarctic sea ice
The central scientific question of WP3 is: **Are recent extremely low Antarctic sea ice states caused
by one driving factor alone being exceptional, or do they instead result from the combined effect
of multiple factors being moderately extreme but not necessarily exceptional?**
